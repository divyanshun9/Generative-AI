# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for Synthetic Image Generation
This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implemented in TensorFlow using PyTorch. The GAN is capable of generating synthetic images for any given dataset. The architecture consists of a discriminator model responsible for distinguishing between real and fake images, and a generator model tasked with generating realistic-looking synthetic images.

## Training
You can use your own dataset for training the GAN. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed, and images are converted into tensors and normalized.

## Evaluation
After training, you can visualize both real and generated images to assess the training progress qualitatively.

## Saved Models
The trained discriminator and generator models are saved for future use, allowing you to generate synthetic images without retraining.

## Generating Images
Using the pretrained models, you can generate synthetic images by running the appropriate script.
